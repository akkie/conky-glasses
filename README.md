Conky Glasses
=============

Conky configuration for my current desktop.

The wallpaper is a modification of a wallpaper called "Clear Vision" and can be found by a [Google search](https://www.google.de/search?q=%22Clear+Vision%22+wallpaper&tbm=isch) in different resolutions. I can't find a link to the modificated wallaper but it seems that this [guy on deviantART](http://aaronolive.deviantart.com/art/September-2012-327946100) has created it.
